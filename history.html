        <h1>Flatbread Is Where It's At</h1>
        <h2>A Brief History of the Roots of Pizza</h2>
        <p>
          The earliest evidence of people using fire to cook food is from the Neanderthal/Homo Sapiens Complex 75,000 years ago. Flour and water Flatbreads baked on a fire-heated rock have been a staple for much of humanity for the past 5,000 years. In Mexico itâ€™s the tortilla; for the Scots it is oatcake; in India, chapatti; in China they call it po bin; the Amerindians made johnnycake; the Norwegians, flattbrod; in Ethiopia, injera; in Israel, matzoh. The grains may be different but the cooking is remarkably the same. Developed independently in various places throughout the world as a solution to the problem of cooking raw flour and water, FLATBREAD united, for the first time, the nutritive value of grain with the pure joys of the palate.
